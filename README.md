# ChocoboColoring

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

Execute the main function (or the compiled jar) with two arguments, being the first the name of the current color of your chocobo, and the second the target color. A correct input will provide the berries you need to feed the chocobo (totals and order), otherwise it will print the available colors.
